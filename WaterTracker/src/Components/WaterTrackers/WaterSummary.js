      <h2>Benefits of Drinking Water</h2>
      <p>
        Getting enough water every day is important for your health. Drinking
        water can prevent dehydration, a condition that can cause unclear
        thinking, result in mood change, cause your body to overheat, and lead
        to constipation and kidney stones. Water has no calories, so it can also
        help with managing body weight and reducing calorie intake when
        substituted for drinks with calories, such as sweet tea or regular soda.
